## Motivation

## Problem Solving Steps
1. Load the data into a dataframe
2. Perform Data Preprocessing like handling missing values, feature creation etc.
3. Perform Eploratory Data Analysis and get valuable insights from the data
4. Perform feature selection and select the best algorithm which fits the data
5. Save the model in a pickle file and integrate the model with the UI which is made using flask.
6. Deploy the model web app on a cloud platform
